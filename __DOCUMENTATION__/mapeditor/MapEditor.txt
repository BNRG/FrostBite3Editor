test-scaling-4x.png -> shows first attempts to test, if the original scaling fits to the editor. Models are 4x bigger as original,
					   so i had to multiply the transformation by 4x.
					   
					   The image is taken from top in the editor and the void got replaced with the minimap of test-range.
					   
mp_playground terrain4k.decals -> 0000A71C seems to start a big_endian int array, with a size of 128x128 + 0x128 bytes left over?
